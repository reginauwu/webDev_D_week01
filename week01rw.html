			<p style="font-size: 30"> As We May Think - Vannevar Bush, 1945
			<p> This article talks about how far humanity has come in making complex concepts and ideas come to life in a cheap price.
			It is written in response to the end of war and to let people know that they should now focus on making technological advances in making knowledge more easily accessible.
			Different technological advances are mentioned such as the camera, television, records, arithmetic machines, etc.
			He makes predictions as to what machines would be created in the future. 
			An example he made is something he named "memex", which seems to be similar to computers and how it can be used to store and search information (like Google).
			It was pretty interesting in how he was able to make such accurate predictions to what we have right now.

			<p style="font-size: 30"> Long Live the Web - Tim Berners Lee, 2010
			<p> This article focuses on the topic of how web is able to let anyone share information with other people from anywhere around the world.
			I agree with the points made on the fact that the web is becoming threatened by monetization and companies. 
			The author also makes a good point on making the web more accessible to people and protecting them from those who wants to track their data.
